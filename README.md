# WhatsApp Contact Gateway
A simple app that shows you your contacts and if you click them, it'll open up a WhatsApp conversation to that particular contact.

## Use case
You don't wanna share all of your contacts with WhatsApp and rather keep it as sandboxed as possible (a very understandable standpoint after reading their current privacy policy).

## Usage
Open up the app. Click on a contact to start a conversation. Long press to open up contact details.

## Download APK
You can get an APK for version 1.0 at the Releases tab.
